# SecureDeployOps!



SecureDeployOps is a DevSecOps GitHub repository that contains scripts, tools, and resources for ensuring secure and efficient deployment of software projects. It includes an Infrastructure as Code script for automating the deployment and configuration of project infrastructure, as well as an Automated Testing script for ensuring that the project code meets security requirements and doesn't introduce any new vulnerabilities.
Features

    Infrastructure as Code script for automating deployment and configuration of project infrastructure
    Automated Testing script for ensuring secure code and preventing vulnerabilities
    Integration with popular DevOps tools and services
    Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for efficient software delivery

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Python 3.6 or later
    Terraform or CloudFormation (for Infrastructure as Code script)
    Pytest or Unittest (for Automated Testing script)

Installation

    Clone the SecureDeployOps repository to your local machine
    Install the required dependencies for the scripts you wish to use (e.g. Terraform, Pytest)
    Follow the instructions in the README file for each script to set up and configure your environment

Usage
Infrastructure as Code Script

The Infrastructure as Code script can be used to automate the deployment and configuration of project infrastructure. It uses Terraform or CloudFormation to provision and configure cloud resources, and includes built-in security checks and configurations to ensure that the infrastructure is secure and compliant.

To use the Infrastructure as Code script:

    Set up your cloud provider credentials and configure your environment as described in the README file
    Run the script with the appropriate command line arguments to specify the desired infrastructure configuration
    Verify that the infrastructure has been provisioned and configured correctly

Automated Testing Script

The Automated Testing script can be used to automate the testing of project code to ensure that it meets security requirements and doesn't introduce any new vulnerabilities. It uses a testing framework like Pytest or Unittest to run a suite of tests on the codebase, and includes built-in security tests and configurations to catch potential vulnerabilities.

To use the Automated Testing script:

    Set up your testing environment and configure the script as described in the README file
    Run the script to execute the suite of tests on the project codebase
    Review the test results and take action as needed to address any identified vulnerabilities or issues
